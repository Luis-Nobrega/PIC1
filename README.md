# PIC1
Implement and develop a workflow for simulation steering and runtime visualization of simulations (for OSIRIS and QuickPIC) in HPC environments

## Goal 1
For simulations on a cluster, generate in real time (via command on prompt or via web service) plots from the simulation data (e.g. using visXD)

## Goal 2 
For simulations on a cluster, issue simulation halt, save data for restart, modify physical parameters, and numerical parameters, restart simulation (eventually resampling saved data on new grid), and restart simulations
(first target would be accelerates or, preferably, deucallion)
